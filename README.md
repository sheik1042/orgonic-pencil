About this topic:

Making pencils from dried leaves is a novel idea because it is a sustainable and environmentally beneficial method. While conventional pencils use wood, which contributes to deforestation, this invention turns natural waste dry leaves into useful goods. By using renewable and biodegradable resources, this approach lessens its impact on the environment and may even result in lower production costs. The idea of recycling waste into a functional product gives value to resources that would otherwise be thrown away, providing a creative solution that encourages sustainability in the pencil manufacturing sector.
